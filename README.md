# BitVMX: a CPU for Universal Computation on Bitcoin

BitVMX is a new framework to optimistically execute arbitrary programs in Bitcoin based on the N-party disputable computation paradigm pioneered by BitVM. 

Our vision is to create a secure, extensible, open-source, peer-reviewed and sidechain-agnostic framework that provides the foundations to run any CPU on Bitcoin, with a focus to run a fully-compliant RISC-V processor programmable using a standard compiling toolchain.

BitVMX can be used to develop blockchain bridges, aggregator oracles, and SNARK/STARK verifiers, which will bring a myriad of new use cases to Bitcoin, from ZK-rollups to crazy use cases such as Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (i.e. autonomous bug bounties paid for disclosure of vulnerabilities).

## Who we are

We are a group of researchers (some independent and some sponsored by companies) that are openly collaborating to achieve the first production-ready implementation of the BitVMX framework and the BitVMX RISC-V processor.
Our objective is to fully pass RISC-V official test suite, and be able to run any RISC-V program (even Linux!) on Bitcoin.

This is a work in progress, anyone is invited to collaborate. Contributions are welcome.
